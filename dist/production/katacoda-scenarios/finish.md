# The End (of part 1)
If this is your first exposure to programming, there was a lot packed into this small lesson. I would encourage you to look over the concepts again to make sure you understand them.
If not, look up the terms online. Wikipedia is a great resource for programming language vocabulary.

The next lesson will dive deeper into object types. We will cover &quot;flow control&quot; and create &quot;methods&quot; to do our bidding (other languages sometimes use the term &quot;functions&quot; instead of &quot;methods&quot;).

Things start to get more interesting, _really_ fast.
