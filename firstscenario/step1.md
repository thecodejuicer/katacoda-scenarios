For this first lesson, you are going to write (rather, complete)
a historical and obligatory introductory program known as &ldquo;Hello, World!&rdquo;. Why is it historical and obligatory?
Because almost every book, tutorial and course in the world of computer programming, begins with the &ldquo;Hello, World!&rdquo;
    program. It is tradition. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%22Hello,_World!%22_program">(Wikipedia article)</a>

What, you ask, is &ldquo;Hello, World!&rdquo; anyhow? It simply prints &ldquo;Hello, World!&rdquo; to the screen.
It isn't terribly exciting. But, it does give us a chance to talk about some important fundamentals.

Since we're using Java&trade;, there are a few things every program need. In your editor is a blank file named <code>HelloWorld.java</code>.
The first thing it needs is a <code>class</code> definition. Make it look like this:
<pre class="file">
public class HelloWorld {
}
</pre>

This doesn't do a whole lot (yet). Let's change that...
