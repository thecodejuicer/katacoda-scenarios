# Introduction to Programming - Part 2: Identifiers and Loops
In part 2, we will dig into identifiers. If you recall the brief intro to them in part 1, they are just the names the programmer gives objects so they can be reused. It is a simple concept, and _very_ important.

Next, you will be introduced to some different data types and their purpose.

The last part of this &quot;scenario&quot; will teach loops (doing a task multiple times). Another important concept in programming.

## Key Takeaways
- Understand valid identifier use.
- Learn some of the primitive Java data types.
- Using looping constructs (for, while and do-while)
