## Primitive Data Types Continued 
Enough integrals. What about real numbers? Like, the ones with decimal points? For this we move on to floating-point numbers.
### Floating-Point Types
`float` is a 32-bit data type. The range is a bit different from the integral types. The reason why is _way_ outside the scope of this lesson. The magnitude of a float is approximately
between 1.4&times;10<sup>-45</sup> to 3.4&times;10<sup>38</sup> (whether positive or negative);

`double` increases the size to 64 bits. The magnitude range is between 4.9&times;10<sup>-324</sup> to 1.7&times;10<sup>308</sup>.
