## Reference Data Types
Using reference types opens up the fun in programming. Really, it's just an identifier that points to a memory address. But what that memory address holds is the important part.

We've already worked with one important reference type: the `String`. A String identifier points to a location in memory which holds characters (the primitive).

Let's say we assign &quot;Hi&quot; to a String named &quot;greeting&quot;, and it gets stored starting at memory address 20. The value of the greeting will be 20, not &quot;Hi&quot;
The value we assigned takes up 4 bytes (32 bits since a character is 16 bits). This assumes a byte is 8 bits, which it typically is.

In memory, it would look something like this:
<pre>
   greeting
           &#10136;
          |----|----|----|----|
address:  | 20 | 21 | 22 | 23 |
          |---------|---------|
  value:  |   'H'   |   'i'   |
          |---------|---------|
</pre>

Java abstracts all the memory stuff from us so we don't have to worry about it. We can use the identifier like it actually has the value we assign it.  
Example:
<pre class="file">
// Assigning the value "Zebra" to the animalType identifier.
String animalType = "Zebra";

// This will print the string like we expect.
System.out.println(animalType);
</pre>
